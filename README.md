## Installation
Steps to use react-taxonomypicker in your React project
### 1.Install from NPM
```
npm install --save react-taxonomypicker
```

### 2. Import and use in your application
```
import TaxonomyPicker from "react-taxonomypicker";
// Include its styles in you build process as well
import "react-taxonomypicker/dist/React.TaxonomyPicker.css";

### 3. Usage
#### Mock / Local mode
Don't configure termSetGuid and load the options from defaultOptions object.
```js
<TaxonomyPicker
  name="Language"
  displayName="Language"
  defaultOptions={[
    { label: "English", value: "f50249b6-310d-43b6-aaa6-f0cb46d851bf", path: "Finance and Corporate;Reporting" },
    { label: "Spanish", value: "237ca323-1ed8-4199-a49b-a9f7ce4256bf", path: "Finance and Corporate" },
    { label: "German", value: "44024c7e-f738-4755-90e1-15866327c806", path: "Reporting" },
    { label: "Italian", value: "65f67491-bdca-491a-84fa-f6fd913f40fa", path: "" },
  ]}
  multi
/>
```

##### Show path as label
```js
<TaxonomyPicker
  name="Language"
  displayName="Language"
  defaultOptions={[
    { label: "English", value: "f50249b6-310d-43b6-aaa6-f0cb46d851bf", path: "Finance and Corporate;Reporting" },
    { label: "Spanish", value: "237ca323-1ed8-4199-a49b-a9f7ce4256bf", path: "Finance and Corporate" },
    { label: "German", value: "44024c7e-f738-4755-90e1-15866327c806", path: "Reporting" },
    { label: "Italian", value: "65f67491-bdca-491a-84fa-f6fd913f40fa", path: "" },
  ]}
  multi
  showPath
/>
```

#### SharePoint environment mode
Configure termSetGuid with the desired term set
```js
<TaxonomyPicker
  name="Language"
  displayName="Language"
  termSetGuid="26ebf149-101a-4996-9df2-8179a537350d"
  termSetName="Language"
  termSetCountMaxSwapToAsync={100}
  multi
  showPath
/>
```


## Done
- Expose as a Module / Global / UMD library
- Upload to npm
- Create [ES6 sample application](https://github.com/jquintozamora/react-taxonomypicker-consume-es6) for usage
- Create [TypeScript sample application](https://github.com/jquintozamora/react-taxonomypicker-consume-typescript) for usage
- Create [SPFx webpart sample for usage](https://github.com/jquintozamora/spfx-react-taxonomypicker)
- Create types and include them with the npm package
- onPickerChange event handler exposed
- react-select properties exposed (extends them)
- termSetCountMaxSwapToAsync property exposed to choose between Sync / Async modes
- defaultOptions array exposed to enable input mock data when no termSetGuid configured
- Create and Expose properties for custom styles

## TODOs
- Create types to allow people include with @types
